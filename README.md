#### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nati Lavega.

:blue_heart: I'm a React developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

:computer: In the last five years, I learned a lot of front-end technologies. React is my favorite.

:fire: I'm currently exploring React and Firebase integration. A great combo.

:open_book: Besides programming, I like to exercise, read books, drink coffee, and travel the world.

ðŸŒ± I'm open to a full-time position as a React developer.

ðŸ“« Feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natilavega/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/natilavega). 

There is still much to be done.
